# Simple Blockchain Simulation

This is a basic blockchain simulation built using Python. It demonstrates how blocks are linked together, how hashing works, and how tampering can be detected.

## Features:
- Block Structure (Index, Timestamp, Transactions, Previous Hash, Current Hash)
- SHA-256 Hashing
- Blockchain Class to manage blocks
- Chain Validation (Detects tampering)
- (Optional) Simple Proof-of-Work

## How to Run:
1. Install Python (if not installed).
2. Clone this repository or download `blockchain.py`.
3. Open terminal and run:

4. The blockchain details will be printed on the screen.

## Example Output:
Block #1 added
Hash: 0000a7d8e2b6...
Block #2 added
Hash: 0000f1b2c3d4...
